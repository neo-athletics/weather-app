# Weather -app

A portfolio won't be complete with the traditional weather app.

I had initially build this project with a different api, but that api was no longer being maintain. So I found an alternative.

I ended up using an api called the weatherapi. What kind of name should we have expected right. So while fixing my code I decided to redo do the styling on the web app.

-   Utilize Grid layout
-   animation to forecast
-   error handling during fetching
-   Forecast display

## Future features

-   get current location of user
-   update search bar with autocomplete location
